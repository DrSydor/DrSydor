- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrSydor
- 👀 I’m interested in cell biology, specifically host-pathogen interactions. Most of my coding is focused on image analysis (light and electron micrographs) and large dataset analysis (i.e. BioID proximity interactomic analysis).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, trying to trick microcontrollers into working using C (clearly unrelated to the above), and maybe taking quick glances at machine learning before getting scared and running away to hide under the covers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on science stuff (clearly, right?)
- 📫 How to reach me: andrew.sydor@gmail.com.
